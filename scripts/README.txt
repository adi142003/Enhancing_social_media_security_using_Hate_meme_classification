Memotion 3.0 is the 3rd iteration of the Memotion task which was conducted at Semeval 2020. The challenge consists of three subtasks:

Task A- Sentiment Analysis: Given an Internet meme, the first task is to classify it as a positive, negative or neutral meme.
Task B- Emotion Classification: Given an Internet meme, the system has to identify the type of emotion expressed. The categories are humorous, sarcastic, offensive and motivational. A meme can have more than one category.
Task C- Scales/Intensity of Emotion Classes: The third task is to quantify the extent to which a particular emotion is being expressed.

Appropriate annotated data will be provided for each task, with Intensity levels for each emotion (Humour, Sarcasm, Offensiveness and Motivation)
